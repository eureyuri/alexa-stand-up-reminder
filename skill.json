You can specify the number of rounds for the work session and we will keep reminding you! \nDuring the 5 minutes break, we suggest random activities that you can enjoy to relax and have fun. By actually resting during this time, your mind will be rejuvenated to tackle problems and strive through the next work sessions. \n\nOut motivation behind this skill is to help you move your body because sitting for a long time has some serious health concerns and we wanted to help you in a natural way.\n\nTo cancel reminders, say \"Alexa, cancel stand up reminder\" or \"Alexa, cancel all reminders\".",
